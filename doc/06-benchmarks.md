Benchmarks
==========

All of this is only ivory tower stuff until we get into hard numbers of
performance, right?  Agreed!  Here are some benchmarks comparing a "pure"
situation with the piecewise mutable one.

The theoretical "best case" of piecewise-mutable (and worst case of pure) is
when you only modify a small part of a data type repeatedly.  This forces
many unnecessary copies in the pure form.

The theoretical "worst case" of piecewise-mutable (and best case of pure) is if
you only ever modify the *entire* data type.

Both of these situations are tested below:

(Only bars of the same color are comparable, and shorter bars are better,
performance-wise)

There are four setups here, compared and contrasted between pure and mutable
versions.

1.  A large ADT with 4 fields each containing 4 subfields (so, 16 total),
    generated by a repeated nesting of `data V4 a = V4 !a !a !a !a`

    1.  Updating only a single part (one field out of four, out of four)
    2.  Updating the entire ADT (all 16 fields)

2.  A composite data type of four `Vector`s of 500k elements each, so 2 million
    elements total.

    1.  Updating only a single part (one item out of 2 million)
    2.  Updating all elements of all four vectors (all 2 million items)

We can see four conclusions:

1.  For a large ADT, updating a single field (or multiple fields, interleaved)
    is going to be faster with *mutable*.  This speedup is between x4 and x5,
    suggesting it is a speedup arising from the fact that the top-level type
    has four fields.
2.  For a large ADT, updating the whole ADT (so just replacing the entire
    thing, no actual copies) is faster just as a pure value by a large factor
    (which is a big testament to GHC).
3.  For a small ADT with huge vectors, updating a single field is *much* faster
    with *mutable*.
4.  For a small ADT with huge vectors, updating the entire value (so, the
    entire vectors and entire ADT) is actually faster with *mutable* as well.

Interestingly, the "update entire structure" case (which should be the
worst-case for *mutable* and the best-case for pure values) actually becomes
faster with *mutable* when you get to the region of *many* values... somewhere
between 16 and 2 million, apparently.  However, this may just be from the
efficiency of modifying vectors sequentially.
